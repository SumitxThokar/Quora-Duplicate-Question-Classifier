The Quora Duplicate Question Classifier is a machine learning project aimed at identifying duplicate questions on the Quora platform. Quora is a popular question-and-answer website where users can ask questions and get answers from a community of users. Duplicate questions can clutter the platform, leading to a poor user experience and redundant content. Therefore, an efficient system that can automatically identify duplicate questions is highly valuable.

This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to build a robust classifier capable of detecting whether two questions are duplicates. By employing state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques, the classifier can analyze the textual content of questions and make accurate predictions of 77%.
